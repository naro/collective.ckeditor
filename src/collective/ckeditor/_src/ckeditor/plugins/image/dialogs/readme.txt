Customized unminified version of image.js taken from
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/4.3.4/plugins/image/dialogs/image.js

The customization contains changed behavior of alignment settings - it uses
image-inline, image-left and image-right instead of 'float' style.

Additionaly, 'captioned' is defualt value for custom class text box.

It would be nice to change this 'captioned' class to a checkbox.
